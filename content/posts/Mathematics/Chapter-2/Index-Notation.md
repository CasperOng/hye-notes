Here we will learn about simple index notation including how to write an expression using index notation and how to simplify expressions written in index form.

### What is index notation?

Index notation is a way of representing numbers (constants) and variables (e.g. x and y) that have been multiplied by themselves a number of times. 

Below are all examples of expressions involving index notations:

We use index notations to simplify expressions or solve equations involving powers.

#### Examples
<details> 
  <summary>Simplify 16 × 16 × 16 × 16</summary>
16 is being multiplied by itself 4 times. <br/>
We can therefore write this as 16⁴ <br/>
This is said as “16 to the power of 4” <br/>
</details>

<details> 
  <summary>Simplify  n × n × n × n</summary>
n is being multiplied by itself 4 times. <br/>
We can therefore write this as n⁴ <br/>
This is said as “n to the power of 4” <br/>
</details>

<details> 
  <summary>Simplify  6y × 6y × 6y × 6y</summary>
6y is being multiplied by itself 4 times. <br/>
We can therefore write this as 6y⁴ <br/>
This is said as “6y to the power of 4” <br/>
